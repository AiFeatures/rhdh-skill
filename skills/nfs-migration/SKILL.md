  Migrate Backstage frontend plugins from the legacy system to the New Frontend
  System (NFS). Use when asked to "migrate to NFS", "new frontend system",

  "ApiBlueprint", "SubPageBlueprint", "alpha to GA", "legacy to NFS",
  "frontend migration", "extension blueprints", "migrate frontend plugin",
  "NFS support", "graduate alpha", or mentions migrating a Backstage plugin
  to the new frontend system for RHDH.

<essential_principles>

<principle name="discover_first">
Always read the plugin's `package.json`, `src/plugin.ts` (or `src/plugin.tsx`), route refs, API factories, and exported components before making any changes. Understand what exists before migrating.
</principle>

<principle name="nfs_at_alpha">
NFS is not GA yet. The default approach is to add NFS at `./alpha` while keeping legacy at the root export (`.`). This avoids breaking existing consumers.
</principle>

<principle name="upstream_apis">
Use `@backstage/frontend-plugin-api` for core blueprints. RHDH-specific blueprints (`AppDrawerContentBlueprint`, `GlobalHeaderMenuItemBlueprint`) come from `@red-hat-developer-hub/*` packages. Don't mix them up.
</principle>

<principle name="modules_not_plugins">
Entity content and cards can go directly in the plugin's `extensions` array — the blueprint declares its own attach point. Use `createFrontendModule` only for extensions that target a different plugin (translations → `pluginId: 'app'`, homepage widgets → `pluginId: 'home'`) or when injecting content from outside a plugin you don't own.
</principle>

<principle name="shared_components">
Keep component imports (`useApi`, `useRouteRef`, etc.) on `@backstage/core-plugin-api` — they work in both legacy and NFS contexts. This lets the same components serve both export paths. Only use `compatWrapper()` when a component depends on legacy context providers (e.g. old `SidebarContext`) that aren't available in NFS. Don't migrate component imports to `@backstage/frontend-plugin-api` if you need to support legacy consumers.
</principle>

<principle name="keep_legacy">
Legacy exports must remain available since NFS is not GA. With the alpha approach, legacy stays at root unchanged. With the colocated approach, legacy source moves to `legacy.ts` but is re-exported from `index.ts` so existing consumers don't break.
</principle>

## What would you like to do?

1. **Migrate a plugin to NFS** — Analyze your existing plugin and convert it to the New Frontend System
2. **Test a migrated plugin in RHDH** — Deploy and verify in a local or cluster RHDH instance
3. **Learn about NFS migration** — Read the migration guide

**Wait for response before proceeding.**

</intake>

<routing>

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1, "migrate", "convert", "NFS" | Follow the migration workflow below |
| 2, "test", "verify", "deploy" | Read `workflows/test-nfs-plugin.md` |
| 3, "learn", "guide", "overview" | Read `references/overview.md` and present key sections to the user |

</routing>

<migration_workflow>

### Step 1: Discover

Read `package.json` and `src/plugin.ts` (or `src/plugin.tsx`). Identify:
- Plugin ID
- Routes and route refs
- API factories
- Routable extensions (pages)
- Component extensions (entity cards, tabs)
- Sidebar/nav items
- Translations
- RHDH-specific extensions (drawers, header items, homepage widgets)
- RHDH dynamic plugin mount points (`app-config.dynamic.yaml` — see `references/mount-point-mapping.md`)

List all findings to the user before proceeding.

If the plugin's `@backstage/*` dependencies are outdated, upgrade them first using the `backstage-upgrade` skill (`../backstage-upgrade/SKILL.md`) before proceeding with migration.

### Step 2: Choose Approach

NFS is not GA yet. Use the **Alpha** approach by default: NFS at `./alpha`, legacy stays at root (`.`).

The **Colocated** approach is the alternative: NFS as default export in `index.ts`, legacy source in `legacy.ts` but re-exported from `index.ts` for backward compatibility. Use this when the user wants NFS and legacy APIs available from the same import path.

### Step 3: Migrate Extensions

For each extension type found in Step 1, load the appropriate reference:

| Extension type | Reference to load |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Pages, API factories | `references/migrate-page.md` |
| Entity content tabs or cards | `references/migrate-entity-content.md` |
| Translations / i18n | `references/migrate-translations.md` |
| RHDH drawers, header items, homepage widgets | `references/migrate-rhdh-extensions.md` |
| App-level wrappers or root elements | `references/migrate-app-level.md` |

Apply each reference's patterns to the discovered extensions. For page plugins, create NFS variants of page components without the page shell (dual header pattern in `migrate-page.md`).

### Step 4: Update package.json

Load `references/package-json.md` and apply the export configuration matching the chosen approach (alpha or colocated).

### Step 5: Update App Wiring

Load `references/app-setup.md` and:
- Add an NFS dev app at `dev/index.tsx` (or `dev/nfs.tsx`) using `createApp` from `@backstage/frontend-defaults`
- Keep the existing legacy dev app working
- Verify consumer imports still resolve (alpha approach: no changes needed; colocated approach: legacy re-exports from `index.ts` maintain compatibility)

### Step 6: Verify

Load `references/verification.md` and run all checks. Run `yarn tsc` from the **workspace root** (not just the plugin directory) to catch consumer import issues.

<reference_index>

| Reference | Load when... |
|-----------|-------------|
| `references/migrate-page.md` | Plugin has pages or API factories |
| `references/api-changes.md` | Updating a plugin migrated against an older NFS version |
| `references/migrate-entity-content.md` | Plugin has entity tabs or cards |
| `references/migrate-translations.md` | Plugin has i18n/translations |
| `references/migrate-rhdh-extensions.md` | Plugin uses RHDH drawer, header, or homepage widgets |
| `references/mount-point-mapping.md` | Plugin uses RHDH dynamic plugin mount points (legacy config) |
| `references/migrate-app-level.md` | Plugin has app-level wrappers or root elements |
| `references/package-json.md` | Updating package.json exports |
| `references/app-setup.md` | Setting up or updating the NFS dev app |
| `references/verification.md` | Verifying the migration |
| `references/testing-rhdh.md` | Testing with a real RHDH instance |
| `references/gotchas.md` | Troubleshooting migration issues |
| `references/reference-prs.md` | Looking for real migration examples |
| `references/operator-config.md` | Plugin uses RHDH operator config or needs `app.extensions` / `app.routes.bindings` reference |
| `references/overview.md` | User wants to learn about NFS before migrating |
| `references/support.md` | User needs help beyond what the skill covers |

<success_criteria>

- `./alpha` (or root, for colocated) default-exports a `createFrontendPlugin` result
- All legacy extensions have NFS Blueprint equivalents
- Pages that need nav entries have `title` and `icon` set (on `PageBlueprint` or `createFrontendPlugin`)
- `package.json` exports NFS at `./alpha` (alpha approach) or `.` (colocated approach)
- Translations are in a `createFrontendModule` with `pluginId: 'app'`
- Entity content extensions are in the plugin's `extensions` array (or a catalog module if injecting from outside)
- `yarn tsc` and `yarn build` pass
- Legacy exports remain available (unchanged at root for alpha; re-exported from `index.ts` for colocated)
